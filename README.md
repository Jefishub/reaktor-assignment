*** NOTES ***

The current version is using https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to fix issues related to CORS. When using this app, a request to use this proxy must be made manually.

Proper error handling is not yet implemented.

Styling might be buggy and not polished.


 *** USE MOCK DATA ***

 To use the mock data instead, please change index.js to render <AppMock /> insted

Assignment brief for junior developers
Planning on applying to our junior positions? Great, below you can find the instructions for our assignment. Remember to add the links to your solution when submitting your application.

Please note: If you applied for our spring trainee positions in November, the assignment might look familiar. However, the API and the brief are slightly different.You must change to use the new v2 API and do other required changes to your application. 

In any case, we encourage you to read the brief carefully, and make the necessary changes to your solution before submitting it.

Instructions
Your client is a clothing brand that is looking for a simple web app to use in their warehouses. To do their work efficiently, the warehouse workers need a fast and simple listing page per product category, where they can check simple product and availability information from a single UI. There are three product categories they are interested in for now: gloves, facemasks, and beanies. Therefore, you should implement three web pages corresponding to those categories that list all the products in a given category. One requirement is to be easily able to switch between product categories quickly. You are free to implement any UI you want, as long as it can display multiple products at once in a straightforward and explicit listing. At this point, it is not necessary to implement filtering or pagination functionality on the page.

The client does not have a ready-made API for this purpose. Instead, they have two different legacy APIs that combined can provide the needed information. The legacy APIs are on critical-maintenance-only mode, and thus further changes to them are not possible. The client knows the APIs are not excellent, but they are asking you to work around any issues in the APIs in your new application. The client has instructed you that both APIs have an internal cache of about 5 minutes.

API documentation is as follows

GET /v2/products/:category â€“ Return a listing of products in a given category.
GET /v2/availability/:manufacturer â€“ Return a list of availability info.
The APIs are running at https://bad-api-assignment.reaktor.com/.
Your task is to implement a web application that fits the client brief and host the running solution somewhere where it can be accessed publicly (e.g. Heroku). Please include a link to the source code and the running application in your application.

Some pointers you might want to take into account

You can keep the UI side simpler than it would be in a real-life situation. You do not need to implement filtering, search, or pagination.
Be mindful of page loading speed and error handling in the application code itself, but using free hosting options with long-ish startup times on the first load is fine.
The API is supposed to resemble working with a real-life legacy API. It has a built-in intentional failure case that you might run into while developing. To ease up reproducing the issue without needing to wait for the next random request failure, we provide a request header: x-force-error-mode. Set to allto force the failure to reproduce.
Have fun! Weâ€™re looking forward to seeing your solution ðŸ˜Š
